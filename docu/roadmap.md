The universeOS Development Roadmap
----------------------------------

1. Get a nice API
    complete encrypted communication via js
    RESTful
    Documented

2. Get File Encryption done



Security
----------
We try to get the script as secure as possible. It is important to point out the most important things we need to take care of:
    1. Javascript Cryptography
    2. A good Cryptoprotocoll which allows
        A Public Key Infrastructure
        Instant Messaging (with Groups)
        An easy exchange of algorithms
    3. Well written and well documented code



=Recent=

    get rid of
        mysql_query
        $.post, $.ajax, load, $.get etc
        api.php
        thousend different column names for user (author, owner, creator, user etc) instead `user`
        chat.show(), feed.show(), buddylist.show() etc. use application.show('buddylist') instead

-add ftp, dropbox like service etc to the filesystem
